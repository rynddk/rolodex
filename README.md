## About

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project uses the `npm` package manager and `Node.js`. You should be using at least Node Dubmium (LTS v10 - 10.23.0) to run this project.

## Setup

Setup for this should be rather straightforward.

1. Ensure your node version is greater than `10.23.0` by typing `node -v` in your terminal. If you need to update your version of node, look in to a [Node package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/).
1. Install dependencies by running `npm i`.
1. Start the app by running `npm start`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run lint`

Lints all js, jsx, and css files using [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/).

### `npm test`

Launches the Cypress test suite.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
